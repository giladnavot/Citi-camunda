title: Exploring the Group Concept
---
In Citi-camunda, a Group refers to a collection of users that share certain attributes or permissions within the system. It is a key concept in managing access control and permissions. Groups can be created, updated, and deleted. Additionally, users can be added to or removed from groups, and various operations can be performed on the group resource itself.
