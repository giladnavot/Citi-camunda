title: Exploring the Tenant Concept
---
In Citi-camunda, a Tenant refers to an entity that is used to segregate processes, cases, and related data within the Camunda Platform. It is a way to partition data into isolated units. Tenants are used to create, update, retrieve, and delete operations. They also have user and group memberships, which can be managed separately.

# Tenant Management

This is where a new tenant is created. The 'name' field represents the name of the tenant.

## Tenant.java

The Tenant.java file is a part of the identity management system in the Camunda BPM engine. It defines the Tenant class, which represents a tenant in the system. A tenant is a group of users that share the same resources in the system. The Tenant class provides methods for managing the tenant's ID, name, and other properties.
