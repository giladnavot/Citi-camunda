title: Overview of Job in Citi-camunda
---
In Citi-camunda, a Job refers to a unit of work that the process engine needs to perform at a given time. These jobs can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted through various API endpoints. Jobs can have different properties such as due date, priority, and retries. They can also be suspended or activated. Each job is identified by a unique ID and errors related to non-existent jobs are handled gracefully.

# Job API Endpoints

This is the endpoint for retrieving a job by its id. It returns a job according to the `Job` interface in the engine.

```ftl
      tag = "Job"
      summary = "Get Job"
      desc = "Retrieves a job by id, according to the `Job` interface in the engine."
```

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/engine-rest/engine-rest-openapi/src/main/templates/paths/job/{id}/delete.ftl" line="5">

---

This is the endpoint for deleting a job. It removes the job with the given id from the system.

```ftl
      tag = "Job"
      summary = "Delete Job"
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/engine-rest/engine-rest-openapi/src/main/templates/paths/job/{id}/retries/put.ftl" line="6">

---

This is the endpoint for setting the number of retries for a job. It allows for the adjustment of the retry count for a job, which can be useful in handling failed jobs.

```ftl
      tag = "Job"
      summary = "Set Job Retries"
```

# Job Suspension APIs

Job Suspension Endpoints

## PUT `/job/suspended`

This endpoint is used to activate or suspend jobs matching a given criterion. The criterion can be one of `jobDefinitionId`, `processDefinitionId`, `processInstanceId`, or `processDefinitionKey`. The request body should be a JSON object containing the criterion and a `suspended` field indicating whether the job(s) should be suspended.

```ftl
<#macro endpoint_macro docsUrl="">
<#-- Generated From File: camunda-docs-manual/public/reference/rest/job/put-activate-suspend-by-proc-def-key/index.html -->
<#-- This file is actually based on four doc files found under put-activate-suspend-by-* as they all describe the same endpoint -->
{
  <@lib.endpointInfo
      id = "updateSuspensionStateBy"
      tag = "Job"
      summary = "Activate/Suspend Jobs"
      desc = "Activates or suspends jobs matching the given criterion.
              This can only be on of:

## PUT `/job/{id}/suspended`

This endpoint is used to activate or suspend a specific job by its id. The id of the job is passed as a path parameter. The request body should be a JSON object with a `suspended` field indicating whether the job should be suspended.
