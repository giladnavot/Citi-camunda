title: Exploring the Role of Templates in Citi-camunda
---
Templates in Citi-camunda are used to define the structure of the output that the engine-rest API produces. They are written in FreeMarker, a Java-based template engine, which can generate text output based on templates and changing data. Templates are used to generate responses for various API endpoints, such as the task/{id}/rendered-form endpoint. They provide a flexible way to control the format of the API response.
