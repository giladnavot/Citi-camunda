## Job Log REST API

The Job Log REST API provides endpoints to query and manage job logs. The `post.ftl` file defines the POST endpoint to query historic job logs. It allows filtering by job log values of different types such as `String`, `Number`, or `Boolean`.

```ftl
<#-- Generated From File: camunda-docs-manual/public/reference/rest/history/job-log/post-job-log-query/index.html -->
<#macro endpoint_macro docsUrl="">
{
  <@lib.endpointInfo
      id = "queryHistoricJobLogs"
      tag = "Historic Job Log"
      summary = "Get Job Logs (POST)"
      desc = "Queries for historic job logs that fulfill the given parameters.
              This method is slightly more powerful than the
              [Get Job Logs](${docsUrl}/reference/rest/history/job-log/get-job-log-query/)
              method because it allows filtering by historic job logs values of the
              different types `String`, `Number` or `Boolean`."
  />

  "parameters" : [

    <#assign last = true >
    <#include "/lib/commons/pagination-params.ftl">
