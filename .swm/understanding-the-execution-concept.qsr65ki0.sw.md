title: Understanding the Execution Concept
---
Execution in the Citi-camunda project refers to the running instance of a process. It is a fundamental concept in the Camunda BPMN platform, representing the smallest unit of work within a process. Executions are responsible for carrying out the modeled behavior of a process, such as transitioning through various states, triggering events, and managing local variables.

The Execution API, as seen in the engine-rest module, provides a set of operations for interacting with executions. These operations include retrieving execution details, triggering an execution, managing local variables of an execution, and more. Each operation is represented by a different endpoint in the API.

# Trigger Execution

This endpoint is used to trigger an execution. It starts or resumes the execution of a process.

```ftl
      tag = "Execution"
      summary = "Trigger Execution"
```

# Manage Execution Variables

This endpoint is used to get the local variables of an execution. These variables can be used to store and manage data within the scope of the execution.

```ftl
      tag = "Execution"
      summary = "Get Local Execution Variables"
```

# Retrieve Execution Data

This endpoint is used to retrieve data about an execution. It provides information about the state of the execution and any associated data.

```ftl
      tag = "Execution"
      summary = "Get Execution"
      desc = "Retrieves an execution by id, according to the `Execution` interface in the
