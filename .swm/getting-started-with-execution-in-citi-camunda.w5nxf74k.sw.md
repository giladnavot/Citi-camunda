title: Getting Started with Execution in Citi-camunda
---
Execution in the context of the Citi-camunda repository refers to the process of running a workflow or process automation. It involves the actual running of the tasks and activities defined in the BPMN 2.0 process engine. This includes the execution of tasks, handling of events, and the management of process instances.

# Execution Process

The execution process begins with defining your workflows and processes using the native BPMN 2.0 process engine. These defined processes are then executed within the Java Virtual Machine, allowing for process implementation, execution, design, operations, and human task management. This execution process is integral to the automation capabilities of the Camunda Platform.

# Execution Functions Overview

The Execution functions are a key part of the Camunda Platform's process automation capabilities. They are used to manage and track the execution of tasks and activities within a workflow.

## HistoricActivityInstance

The `HistoricActivityInstance` function is used to track the execution of activities within a process. It provides historical data about the activity, such as when it was started, ended, and the duration.

## HistoricTaskInstance
