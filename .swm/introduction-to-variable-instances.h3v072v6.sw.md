title: Introduction to Variable Instances
---
A Variable Instance in Camunda refers to a specific instance of a variable that is created during the execution of a process. It holds the value of a variable at a particular point in time and is associated with a specific execution or task within the process.

Variable Instances are used to store and manage data within a process. They can be created, updated, and deleted as the process progresses, allowing for dynamic data handling.

The Variable Instance API in the engine-rest module provides endpoints for managing Variable Instances. This includes retrieving a Variable Instance by its ID, getting the binary data of a Variable Instance, and counting the number of Variable Instances.

# Variable Instance Creation

This file contains the implementation of a Variable Instance. It shows how a Variable Instance is created and how its value can be set and retrieved.

# Variable Instance Usage

This file demonstrates how Variable Instances are used within a service task. It shows how the process retrieves the value of a Variable Instance and uses it to control the flow of the process.

# Variable Instance Functions

Let's delve into the functions of Variable Instance.

## VariableInstanceDto

The `VariableInstanceDto` is a Data Transfer Object that carries data between processes. It is used to encapsulate variable instance data for transmission over the network.
