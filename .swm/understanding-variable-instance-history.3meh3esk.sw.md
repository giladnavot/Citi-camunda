title: Understanding Variable Instance History
---
Variable Instance History refers to the historical data of a variable instance in the Camunda Platform. It provides a way to track and manage the lifecycle of a variable instance, including its creation, modification, and deletion. This is particularly useful for auditing and debugging purposes.

The Variable Instance History is accessible through various API endpoints. These endpoints allow you to get a variable instance, get the count of variable instances, and delete a variable instance. Each of these operations is associated with a specific path in the 'history/variable-instance' directory.

For example, the 'get' operation retrieves the details of a variable instance, while the 'delete' operation removes a variable instance. The 'count' operation, on the other hand, returns the total number of variable instances. These operations can be performed either via a GET or POST request, depending on the specific endpoint.

## Retrieving Variable Instances

This API endpoint is used to retrieve a specific variable instance by its ID. If the variable instance does not exist, an error message is returned.

```ftl
      tag = "Historic Variable Instance"
      summary = "Get Variable Instance"
```

## Deleting Variable Instances

This API endpoint is used to delete a specific variable instance by its ID. If the variable instance does not exist, an error message is returned.

```ftl
      tag = "Historic Variable Instance"
      summary = "Delete Variable Instance"
```

---

## Getting Variable Instance Count

This API endpoint is used to get the count of variable instances. This can be useful for understanding the volume of variables within a process instance.

```ftl
      tag = "Historic Variable Instance"
      summary = "Get Variable Instance Count"
```

# Variable Instance History Functions

The Variable Instance History is a key component in the Camunda Platform 7. It is used to track the changes in the variables over the lifecycle of a process instance. This allows for a detailed audit trail and can be used for debugging, analysis, and reporting purposes.

## HistoricVariableInstanceDto

The `HistoricVariableInstanceDto` class is a Data Transfer Object that carries the data of a historic variable instance between processes. It includes information such as the variable's name, type, value, and the process instance it is associated with.
