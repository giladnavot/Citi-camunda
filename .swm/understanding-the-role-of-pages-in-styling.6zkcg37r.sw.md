title: Understanding the Role of Pages in Styling
---
In Citi-camunda, 'Pages' refers to a directory located at 'webapps/frontend/ui/cockpit/client/styles/pages'. This directory contains style files for different pages of the application. Each file corresponds to a specific page and defines the look and feel of that page. For example, 'repository.less' contains styles for the repository page, 'process-instance.less' for the process instance page, and 'batch.less' for the batch page.

# Page Structure

This is an example of a typical page in the application. It includes a header, a main content area, and a footer. The header typically contains navigation controls, the main content area contains the bulk of the page's content, and the footer contains additional information or controls.

# Page Navigation

This is where the application's routing is defined. It determines which page is displayed based on the current URL. This allows users to navigate between pages by changing the URL.

# The 'Page' Class

The 'Page' class is a fundamental part of the application, providing the structure and functionality of a page.

## The 'Page' Class

The 'Page' class represents a page in the application. It provides methods for managing the page's properties and behavior. This includes methods for setting and getting the page's first result and max results, which are used for pagination.
