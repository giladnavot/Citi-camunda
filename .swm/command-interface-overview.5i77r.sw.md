title: Command Interface Overview
---
This document will cover the `Command` interface in the Citi-camunda project. We'll cover:

1. What is `Command`
2. Variables and functions in `Command`
3. Usage example of `Command`

# What is Command

`Command` is an interface in the Citi-camunda project. It is used to define a command that can be executed within a `CommandContext`. It also provides a mechanism to determine if the command is retryable in case of a `CrdbTransactionRetryException`.

# Variables and functions

The function `execute` is the main function of the `Command` interface. It takes a `CommandContext` as an argument and returns a generic type `T`. This function is meant to be implemented by any class that implements the `Command` interface and defines the main logic of the command.

```java
  T execute(CommandContext commandContext);
```

The function `isRetryable` is used to determine if the command can be retried in case of a `CrdbTransactionRetryException`. By default, it returns false, indicating that the command is not retryable. This function can be overridden by any class that implements the `Command` interface to specify its own retry logic.

```java
  default boolean isRetryable() {
    return false;
```

# Usage example

`SetAnnotationForIncidentCmd` is an example of a class that implements the `Command` interface. It defines its own `execute` function and uses the `Command` interface to interact with the `CommandContext`.
