title: Introduction to Engine REST in Camunda
---
Engine REST in Citi-camunda refers to the REST API provided by the Camunda BPM platform. This API allows developers to interact with the process engine and perform various operations such as starting a process instance, completing a task, or retrieving process definitions. The API is designed to be highly flexible and integrable, making it easy to embed within any Java application.

# Engine REST Implementation

The `getUserRestService` method is an example of how the REST API is implemented. It creates a new instance of `UserRestServiceImpl`, which provides the REST API for user-related operations. The `engineName` parameter is used to specify which process engine to use.

```java
  public UserRestService getUserRestService(String engineName) {
    String rootResourcePath = getRelativeEngineUri(engineName).toASCIIString();
    UserRestServiceImpl subResource = new UserRestServiceImpl(engineName, getObjectMapper());
    subResource.setRelativeRootResourceUri(rootResourcePath);
    return subResource;
  }
```

# Engine REST Usage

The `HistoricProcessDefinitionRestServiceImpl` class extends `AbstractRestProcessEngineAware`, which means it can use the REST API provided by the engine. This class provides the REST API for operations related to historic process definitions.

```java
public class HistoricProcessDefinitionRestServiceImpl extends AbstractRestProcessEngineAware implements HistoricProcessDefinitionRestService {
```
