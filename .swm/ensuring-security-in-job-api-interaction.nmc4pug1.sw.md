title: Ensuring Security in Job API Interaction
---
This document will cover the security implementation in the Job's API interaction in the Citi-camunda project. We'll cover:

1. How the Job's API handles exceptions
2. How the Job's API handles authorization
3. How the Job's API handles non-existing jobs.

# Exception Handling in Job's API

The Job's API handles exceptions by throwing an `AuthorizationException` when the set retries operation fails. This is done in the `testSetRetriesThrowsAuthorizationException` method.

# Authorization in Job's API

The Job's API handles authorization by throwing an `AuthorizationException` when the execute job operation fails. This is done in the `testExecuteJobThrowsAuthorizationException` method.

# Handling Non-Existing Jobs

The Job's API handles non-existing jobs by throwing an `AuthorizationException` when the set retries operation is attempted on a non-existing job. This is done in the `testSetRetriesNonExistentJob` method.
