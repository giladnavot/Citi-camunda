title: Overview of Authorization
---
Authorization in Citi-camunda refers to the process of granting or denying access to specific resources in the application. It is a security measure that ensures that users can only access the resources they are permitted to use. This is achieved through the use of authorization checks, which are implemented in various parts of the application.
