title: Introduction to Process Instances
---
A Process Instance in Camunda represents a single execution of a process definition. It is the concrete representation of a running process, containing the current state, variables, and activity of that process. Each instance has a unique ID and can be manipulated and queried through various parts of the Camunda platform, such as the Cockpit or the REST API. Process Instances are used extensively throughout the Citi-camunda codebase, particularly in the Cockpit's frontend, where they are displayed, sorted, and managed.

# Process Instance in Code

Here, a Process Instance is being used as a controller in the 'CalledProcessInstanceTable' component. This allows the component to interact with the process instance and its associated data.

```javascript
      controller: 'CalledProcessInstanceController',
      priority: 10
```

---

In this code snippet, a function called 'processInstance' is defined which returns the current process instance from the scope. This function can be used to retrieve the current process instance when needed.

```javascript
              processInstance: function() {
                return $scope.processInstance;
              }
```

---

Here, the process instance is being used to create a new child scope for user task data. This allows the user task data to be associated with the specific process instance.

```javascript
        processInstance = $scope.processInstance,
        taskIdIdToExceptionMessageMap,
```

---

In this HTML template, the process instance is being used to generate a table of called process instances. Each row in the table represents a single process instance, with the 'id' of the process instance being used as a unique identifier.

```html
        <td class="called-process-instance"
            cam-widget-clipboard="calledProcessInstance.id">
          <a href="#/process-instance/{{ calledProcessInstance.id }}/runtime">
            {{ calledProcessInstance.id }}
          </a>
        </td>
```

## Creation of Process Instances

The creation of a process instance is handled by the `ProcessInstance` class. This class provides methods to start a new process instance, set variables for the process instance, and retrieve the process instance's ID and process definition ID.

## Execution of Process Instances

The execution of a process instance is managed by the `ActivityInstantiationBuilder` class. This class provides methods to control the execution flow of the process instance, such as starting a specific activity in the process instance.

## Termination of Process Instances

The termination of a process instance is handled by the `cancelProcessInstanceAction` function. This function provides a user interface for users to cancel a running process instance.
