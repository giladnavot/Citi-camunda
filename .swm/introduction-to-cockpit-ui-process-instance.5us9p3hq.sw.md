title: Introduction to Cockpit UI Process Instance
---
The Cockpit UI Process Instance in the Citi-camunda repository refers to the visual representation and management of a single instance of a process within the Camunda Cockpit. It provides a detailed view of the process, including its current state, variables, and activities. It also allows for interaction with the process instance, such as modifying variables, handling user tasks, and managing incidents. The Cockpit UI Process Instance is primarily implemented in JavaScript and HTML, and is part of the Camunda Webapp frontend.

# Process Instance Table

This file defines the HTML structure of the process instance table. It uses AngularJS directives to bind data to the UI and handle user interactions.

```html
<!-- # CE - camunda-bpm-webapp/webapp/src/main/resources-plugin/base/app/views/processInstance/called-process-instance-table.html -->
<div cam-widget-loader
     loading-state="{{ loadingState }}"
     text-empty="{{ 'PLUGIN_CALLED_PROCESS_NO_PROCESS_INSTANCES' | translate }}">
  <table class="called-process-instance cam-table">

    <thead sortable-table-head
           head-columns="headColumns"
           on-sort-change="onSortChange(sortObj)"
           default-sort="sortObj">
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr ng-repeat="calledProcessInstance in calledProcessInstances | orderBy:sortObj.sortBy:sortObj.sortReverse">
        <td class="state">
          <div ng-if="calledProcessInstance.incidents.length > -1" state-circle incidents="calledProcessInstance.incidents"></div>
          <div ng-if="calledProcessInstance.incidents == undefined">
            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-refresh animate-spin"></span>
          </div>
        </td>
        <td class="called-process-instance"
```

# Process Instance Controller

This file defines the controller for the process instance table. It handles the logic for loading process instances, sorting them, and updating the view when the data changes.

```javascript
  ngModule.controller('CalledProcessInstanceController', [
    '$scope',
    'PluginProcessInstanceResource',
    '$translate',
    'localConf',
    function($scope, PluginProcessInstanceResource, $translate, localConf) {
      // input: processInstance, processData

      var calledProcessInstanceData = $scope.processData.newChild($scope);

      // var processInstance = $scope.processInstance;

      // prettier-ignore
      $scope.headColumns = [
        { class: 'state', request: 'incidents', sortable: true, content: 'State' },
        { class: 'called-process-instance', request: 'id', sortable: true, content: $translate.instant('PLUGIN_CALLED_PROCESS_PROCESS_INSTANCE')},
        { class: 'process-definition', request: 'processDefinitionLabel', sortable: true, content: $translate.instant('PLUGIN_CALLED_PROCESS_PROCESS_DEFINITION')},
        { class: 'activity', request: 'instance.name', sortable: true, content: $translate.instant('PLUGIN_CALLED_PROCESS_ACTIVITY')}
      ];

      // Default sorting
```
