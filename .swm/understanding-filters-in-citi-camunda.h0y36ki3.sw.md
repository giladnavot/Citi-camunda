title: Understanding Filters in Citi-camunda
---
In Citi-camunda, a Filter refers to a functionality that allows users to create, update, delete, and execute operations on data. It is used to manage and manipulate data according to specific criteria. Filters are identified by unique IDs and can be used to retrieve single or multiple results. They are also used to count the number of data entries that meet the specified criteria.
