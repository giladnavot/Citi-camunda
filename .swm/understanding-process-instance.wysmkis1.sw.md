title: Understanding Process Instance
---
A Process Instance in Camunda refers to an execution of a process definition. It represents a single path of execution through a process, including its current state, past activities, and data associated with the process. It's essentially a running instance of a process model, with its own set of variables and activities.

## Starting a Process Instance

This code snippet shows how to start a Process Instance. The `startProcessInstanceByKey` method is used, which takes the process definition key as a parameter. This key is used to find the latest version of the process definition and start a new instance of it.

## Managing Process Instances

This code snippet shows how to manage Process Instances. The `runtimeService` provides methods to control and query Process Instances. For example, the `suspendProcessInstanceById` method is used to suspend a running Process Instance.

# Functions of Process Instance

Let's delve into the functions of Process Instance.

## ProcessInstanceQuery.java

The ProcessInstanceQuery.java file contains functions for querying process instances. These functions allow you to retrieve process instances based on various criteria, such as process definition, business key, and process instance variables.
