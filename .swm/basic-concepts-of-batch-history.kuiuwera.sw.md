title: Basic Concepts of Batch History
---
Batch History in Citi-camunda refers to the historical data of batch operations. It provides functionalities such as retrieving the count of cleanable batch reports, getting a cleanable batch report, setting the removal time for a batch, deleting a historic batch, and getting a historic batch or its count. These operations are crucial for managing and maintaining the process engine's history.
