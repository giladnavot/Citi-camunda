title: Understanding the Cockpit UI
---
Cockpit UI is the user interface component of the Camunda Platform. It is designed to provide a visual interface for process management and operations. The Cockpit UI is built using JavaScript and AngularJS, and it interacts with the Camunda Platform's backend services to fetch and display data. It provides features like process instance monitoring, batch operations, and task management. The UI is modular and extendable, allowing developers to add custom plugins to enhance its functionality.

# Cockpit UI Initialization

This section of the code is responsible for initializing the Cockpit UI. It sets up the AngularJS module for the application, configures various providers, and bootstraps the application. It also exposes certain packages to the global scope for use by plugins.

```javascript
export function init(pluginDependencies) {
  var ngDependencies = [
    'ng',
    'ngResource',
    'pascalprecht.translate',
    commons.name,
    require('./repository/main').name,
    require('./batches/main').name,
    require('./reports/main').name,
    require('./directives/main').name,
    require('./filters/main').name,
    require('./pages/main').name,
    require('./resources/main').name,
    require('./services/main').name,
    require('./navigation/main').name
  ].concat(
    pluginDependencies.map(function(el) {
      return el.ngModuleName;
    })
  );

```

# Cockpit UI Components

This part of the code exposes various packages that are used by the Cockpit UI. These packages include AngularJS, jQuery, Camunda Commons UI, Camunda BPM SDK JS, and others. These packages are made available in the global scope for use by plugins.

```javascript
export function exposePackages(container) {
  container.angular = angular;
  container.jquery = $;
  container['camunda-commons-ui'] = commons;
  container['camunda-bpm-sdk-js'] = sdk;
  container['angular-data-depend'] = dataDepend;
  container['moment'] = moment;
  container['events'] = events;
  container['cam-common'] = camCommon;
  container['lodash'] = lodash;
}
```

# Cockpit UI Plugins

This section of the code defines the AngularJS module for the Cockpit UI plugins. It includes various plugins such as base, decisionList, jobDefinition, tasks, and externalTasksTab.

```javascript
export default angular.module('cockpit.plugin.cockpitPlugins', [
  base.name,
  decisionList.name,
  jobDefinition.name,
  tasks.name,
  externalTasksTab.name
]);
```

# Cockpit UI Views

This HTML file defines the view for the batch management feature of the Cockpit UI. It includes various controls for searching, sorting, and paginating batches, as well as displaying batch details and progress.

```html
<div class="batch-wrapper">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>{{ 'BATCHES_PROGRESS_IN' | translate }}</h3>

      <div cam-widget-search
           cam-widget-search-total="ctrl.getBatchCount('runtime')"
           cam-widget-search-valid-searches="search.searches"
           cam-widget-search-translations="search.translations"
           cam-widget-search-types="search.types"
           cam-widget-search-operators="search.operators"
           cam-widget-search-storage-group="'BIP'"
           cam-widget-search-mode="filter"></div>

      <div cam-widget-loader
           loading-state="{{ ctrl.getLoadingState('runtime') }}"
           text-empty="{{ 'BATCHES_PROGRESS_NO_RUNNING' | translate }}">

        <table class="cam-table">
          <thead sortable-table-head
                 head-columns="runtimeHeadColumns"
```
