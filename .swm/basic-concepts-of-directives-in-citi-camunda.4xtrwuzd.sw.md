title: Basic Concepts of Directives in Citi-camunda
---
Directives in the Citi-camunda project refer to the stylesheets that are used to control the appearance of the user interface elements in the Camunda Cockpit. These stylesheets, written in LESS, are used to define the look and feel of various components such as process diagrams, state circles, resource content, and more. They play a crucial role in ensuring a consistent and user-friendly interface across the application.

# Usage of Directives

This is an example of a custom directive. It is declared with the `@Directive` decorator and the selector 'appExample'. This directive can be used in an HTML template by adding 'appExample' as an attribute to an element.

# Applying Directives

Here, the 'appExample' directive is applied to a div element. The directive will manipulate the div and its children based on its internal logic.
