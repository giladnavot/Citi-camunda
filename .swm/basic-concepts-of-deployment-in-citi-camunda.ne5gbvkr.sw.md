title: Basic Concepts of Deployment in Citi-camunda
---
Deployment in Citi-camunda refers to the process of moving the developed workflow or process automation from a development environment to a production environment. It involves the creation, registration, and management of deployments. This is facilitated through various REST API endpoints, each serving a specific function such as creating a new deployment, retrieving information about registered deployments, deleting a deployment, redeploying a deployment, and managing deployment resources.

# Deployment Process

This section of the code in `DeploymentManager.java` handles the creation of the process archive (PAR) and its deployment to the Camunda engine. It uses the `RepositoryService` to create a deployment, add resources to it, and then deploy it.

# Deployment Verification

After deployment, it's important to verify that the deployment was successful. This section of the code in `DeploymentManager.java` retrieves the deployed process definitions from the Camunda engine using the `RepositoryService` and checks if the expected process definitions are present.

# Functions of Deployment

Let's delve into the functions of Deployment in the Citi-camunda project.

## DeploymentWithDefinitionsDto

The `DeploymentWithDefinitionsDto` function is a Data Transfer Object that carries deployment data along with definitions between processes.

## DeploymentOperation

The `DeploymentOperation` function is responsible for the operation of deployment, managing the process of deploying the workflow and process automation.
