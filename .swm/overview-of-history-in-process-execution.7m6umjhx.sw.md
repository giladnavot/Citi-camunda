title: Overview of History in Process Execution
---
History in the Citi-camunda repository refers to the historical data related to the execution of processes. It includes information about process instances, tasks, incidents, job logs, external task logs, activity instances, decision instances, batches, user operations, details, cleanups, identity link logs, variable instances, and process definitions. These historical data are crucial for understanding the past states of processes, identifying bottlenecks, and making informed decisions for process improvements.
