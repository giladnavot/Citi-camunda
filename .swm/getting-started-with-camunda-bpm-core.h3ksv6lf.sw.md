title: Getting Started with Camunda BPM Core
---
Camunda BPM Core is the heart of the Camunda Platform. It is a Java-based framework that provides a robust process engine for executing BPMN 2.0 processes. The core engine is highly flexible and can be embedded in any Java application or runtime container. It is responsible for executing the workflow definitions, managing process instances, and handling tasks and events within the process.
