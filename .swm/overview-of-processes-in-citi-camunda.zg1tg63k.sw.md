title: Overview of Processes in Citi-camunda
---
Processes in Citi-camunda refer to the sequence of tasks that are part of a workflow. They are defined using the BPMN 2.0 standard and are executed by the Camunda process engine. Processes are integral to the automation capabilities of the platform, allowing for complex business workflows to be modeled and executed programmatically.

# Batch Endpoint and Controller

Batch View Endpoint

<SwmSnippet path="/webapps/frontend/ui/cockpit/client/scripts/batches/config/routes.js" line="26">

---

## /batch Endpoint

The '/batch' endpoint is defined in the 'routes.js' file. When this endpoint is hit, it renders a template and uses a controller to manage the view. It requires authentication and does not reload on search.

```javascript
    $routeProvider.when('/batch', {
      template: template,
      controller: ctrl,
      authentication: 'required',
      reloadOnSearch: false
    });
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/webapps/frontend/ui/cockpit/client/scripts/batches/controllers/view-ctrl.js" line="32">

---

## Batch View Controller

The 'view-ctrl.js' file is the controller for the '/batch' endpoint. It handles various operations such as loading details, opening modals, and handling events related to batches.

```javascript
  '$scope',
  'page',
  'camAPI',
  '$location',
  '$uibModal',
  '$translate',
  'Notifications',
  'localConf',
  'configuration',
  'searchWidgetUtils',
  function(
    $scope,
    page,
    camAPI,
    $location,
    $modal,
    $translate,
    Notifications,
    localConf,
    configuration,
    searchWidgetUtils
```
