title: Understanding the Group Concept
---
In the context of the Citi-camunda repository, a 'Group' refers to a collection of users who share common access rights or roles within the Camunda BPM platform. It is a key concept in managing user permissions and access control. The 'Group' concept is used in the REST API endpoints to perform operations such as creating a new group, retrieving group information, updating a group, and deleting a group. It also allows for operations on group members and counting the number of groups.

# Defining Groups

This section of the code shows how to define a new group. You need to specify the group's name and role.

# Assigning Users to Groups

This section of the code shows how to assign a user to a group. You need to specify the user's ID and the group's name.

# Defining Access Control Policies for Groups

This section of the code shows how to define access control policies for a group. You need to specify the group's name and the permissions that should be granted to it.

# Group Functions

Let's take a look at the Group functions in the 'Groups.java' and 'group.js' files.

## Group Functions in 'group.js'

The 'group.js' file contains the implementation of the Group functions. These functions interact with the backend to perform the actual operations on the user groups.
