title: Understanding Tasklist Navigation
---
Tasklist Navigation refers to the functionality that allows users to navigate through different views in the tasklist application. It is implemented using AngularJS, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. The navigation functionality is primarily handled by two controllers: `camLayoutCtrl` and `camHeaderViewsCtrl`. The `camLayoutCtrl` controller manages the layout of the tasklist application, while the `camHeaderViewsCtrl` controller manages the actions available in the navigation bar of the tasklist application.

# Tasklist Navigation Module

This is where the Tasklist Navigation module is defined. It requires AngularJS and two controllers: `camLayoutCtrl` and `camHeaderViewsCtrl`. The module is then exported for use in other parts of the application.

```javascript
var navigationModule = angular.module('cam.tasklist.navigation', [
  require('camunda-commons-ui/lib/util/index').name,
  'ui.bootstrap'
]);

navigationModule.controller('camHeaderViewsCtrl', camHeaderViewsCtrl);
navigationModule.controller('camLayoutCtrl', camLayoutCtrl);

module.exports = navigationModule;
```

# Navigation Controllers

This is an example of how a navigation controller is used. In this case, the `camHeaderViewsCtrl` controller is used to manage the navbar actions and variables. It uses the `Views` service to get the providers for the `tasklist.navbar.action` component.

```javascript
  'Views',
  function($scope, Views) {
    $scope.navbarVars = {read: ['tasklistApp']};
    $scope.navbarActions = Views.getProviders({
      component: 'tasklist.navbar.action'
```

# Tasklist Navigation Functions

Let's look at the functions in `cam-header-views-ctrl.js` and `cam-layout-ctrl.js`.

## cam-header-views-ctrl.js

In `cam-header-views-ctrl.js`, the `$scope.navbarVars` and `$scope.navbarActions` are defined. `$scope.navbarVars` is used to read the tasklist app, and `$scope.navbarActions` is used to get the providers for the tasklist navbar action.

```javascript
  'Views',
  function($scope, Views) {
    $scope.navbarVars = {read: ['tasklistApp']};
    $scope.navbarActions = Views.getProviders({
      component: 'tasklist.navbar.action'
    });
  }
```

## cam-layout-ctrl.js

In `cam-layout-ctrl.js`, the `cam.tasklist.navigation` module is defined, which includes the controllers for the header views and layout of the tasklist.
