title: Understanding Tasks in Citi-camunda
---
A Task in the context of Citi-camunda refers to a unit of work that the system performs as part of a process. Tasks are defined in the process model (BPMN 2.0) and are created during the execution of a process instance. They can be performed by the system (Service Task) or by a human (User Task). Tasks can be managed, assigned, and completed through the provided REST API endpoints.

# Defining a Task

Here we can see a task being defined within a process model. The `createTask()` method is used to create a new task and set its properties.

# Executing a Task

This snippet shows how a task is executed using the `executeTask()` method. The task is identified by its ID, and the method performs the action associated with the task.
