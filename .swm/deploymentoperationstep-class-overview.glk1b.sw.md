title: DeploymentOperationStep Class Overview
---
This document will cover the `DeploymentOperationStep` class. We'll discuss:

1. What `DeploymentOperationStep` is and its purpose.
2. The variables and functions within `DeploymentOperationStep`.
3. An example of how `DeploymentOperationStep` is used in `StartManagedThreadPoolStep`.

# What is DeploymentOperationStep

`DeploymentOperationStep` is an abstract class that represents an atomic step as part of a composite `DeploymentOperation`. It is used to define the structure of a deployment operation step in the Camunda BPM platform.

# Variables and functions

`DeploymentOperationStep` does not contain any variables. However, it defines three abstract methods: `getName`, `performOperationStep`, and `cancelOperationStep`.

# Variables and functions

The `getName` function is an abstract method that should return the name of the operation step when implemented.

```java
  public abstract String getName();
```

---

<SwmSnippet path="/engine/src/main/java/org/camunda/bpm/container/impl/spi/DeploymentOperationStep.java" line="29">

---

The `performOperationStep` function is an abstract method that should define the operation to be performed during the deployment step when implemented.

```java
  public abstract void performOperationStep(DeploymentOperation operationContext);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/engine/src/main/java/org/camunda/bpm/container/impl/spi/DeploymentOperationStep.java" line="31">

---

The `cancelOperationStep` function is an abstract method that should define the operation to be performed if the deployment step fails. By default, it does nothing.

```java
  public void cancelOperationStep(DeploymentOperation operationContext){
    // default behavior is to to nothing if the step fails
  }
```

# Usage example

`DeploymentOperationStep` is an abstract class and is meant to be extended by other classes. An example of this is the `StartManagedThreadPoolStep` class.

<SwmSnippet path="/engine/src/main/java/org/camunda/bpm/container/impl/deployment/jobexecutor/StartManagedThreadPoolStep.java" line="1">

---

# Usage example

Here, `StartManagedThreadPoolStep` extends `DeploymentOperationStep` and implements the abstract methods defined in `DeploymentOperationStep`.
