title: Understanding Batch Operations
---
Batch in Citi-camunda refers to a set of operations that are executed as a group. It is a concept used in the Camunda Platform to handle large volumes of process instances, tasks, or decisions. Batches are created, managed, and executed through the Batch interface in the engine. They provide functionalities such as retrieving a batch by id, suspending a batch, and deleting a batch. Additionally, they offer methods to get batch statistics and count.

# Batch Operations

This is an example of a batch operation. The batch ID is used to retrieve the status of the batch.

```ftl
      tag = "Batch"
      summary = "Get"
      desc = "Retrieves a batch by id, according to the Batch interface in the engine." />
```

# Batch Statistics

Batch statistics provide an overview of the progress of all batch operations. This can be used to monitor the overall performance of batch processing.

```ftl
      tag = "Batch"
      summary = "Get Statistics"
      desc = "Queries for batch statistics that fulfill given parameters.
              Parameters may be the properties of batches, such as the id or type.
              The size of the result set can be retrieved by using the 
              [Get Batch Statistics Count](${docsUrl}/reference/rest/batch/get-statistics-query-count/) method." />

# Batch Functionality

Batch functionality in Citi-camunda is a crucial part of the process automation. It allows for execution of a series of jobs in a controlled manner.

## BatchDto

BatchDto is a Data Transfer Object that carries data between processes. It's used to encapsulate batch data as it's moved around.
