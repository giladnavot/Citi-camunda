# What is ProcessEngineLogger

`ProcessEngineLogger` is a class that extends `BaseLogger`. It is used for logging various events and information in the Camunda BPM engine. It provides a set of static loggers for different components of the engine, each identified by a unique project code. These loggers are used throughout the engine to log events such as process engine creation, initialization, and exceptions.

# Variables and functions

`ProcessEngineLogger` defines a set of static variables and functions. Each variable represents a logger for a specific component of the engine, and each function provides a specific logging operation.

## Variable: PROJECT_CODE

`PROJECT_CODE` is a constant string that represents the project code for the engine. It is used as a prefix for the logger names.

```java
  public static final String PROJECT_CODE = "ENGINE";
```

## Function: shouldLogJobException

`shouldLogJobException` is a function that determines whether a job exception should be logged. It checks the engine configuration and the job's retry count.

```java
  public static boolean shouldLogJobException(ProcessEngineConfiguration processEngineConfiguration, JobEntity currentJob) {
    boolean enableReducedJobExceptionLogging = processEngineConfiguration.isEnableReducedJobExceptionLogging();
    return currentJob == null || !enableReducedJobExceptionLogging || enableReducedJobExceptionLogging && currentJob.getRetries() <= 1;
  }
```

## Function: shouldLogCmdException

`shouldLogCmdException` is a function that determines whether a command exception should be logged. It checks the engine configuration.

```java
  public static boolean shouldLogCmdException(ProcessEngineConfiguration processEngineConfiguration) {
    return processEngineConfiguration.isEnableCmdExceptionLogging();
  }
```

# Usage example

`ProcessEngineLogger` is used throughout the Camunda BPM engine. For example, the `EnginePersistenceLogger` class uses the `PERSISTENCE_LOGGER` instance of `ProcessEngineLogger` to log events related to engine persistence.
