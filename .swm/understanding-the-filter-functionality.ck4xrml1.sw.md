title: Understanding the Filter Functionality
---
Filter in Citi-camunda refers to a functionality that allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete filters. Filters are used to narrow down the data that is displayed in the process instances, tasks, and reports. They can be applied to various parameters such as process definition, variables, and tenant id. This helps in managing large volumes of data and focusing on the relevant information.
