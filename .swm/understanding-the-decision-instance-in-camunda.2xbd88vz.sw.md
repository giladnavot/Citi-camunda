title: Understanding the Decision Instance in Camunda
---
A Decision Instance in the Citi-camunda project refers to a specific execution of a decision definition. It is the result of evaluating a decision, such as a business rule, within the Camunda BPMN process engine. The decision instance contains the input and output variables used and produced during the evaluation.

The decision instance is represented in the frontend of the application, specifically within the Cockpit plugin. The files in the 'decisionInstance' directory handle the display of the decision instance's details, including input and output variables.

# Decision Instance Inputs

# Decision Instance Functions

This section will delve into the functions of the Decision Instance, focusing on how it handles input and output variables.

<SwmSnippet path="/webapps/frontend/ui/cockpit/plugins/decisionList/app/views/decisionInstance/inputTable.js" line="35">

## Input Variable Handling

The input variable handling function maps the inputs of the decision instance into a format that can be used in the application. It checks the type of each variable and formats it accordingly. For instance, if the variable type is 'Date', it converts the value into a Date object.

```javascript
          $scope.loadingState =
            $scope.decisionInstance.inputs.length > 0 ? 'LOADED' : 'EMPTY';
          $scope.variables = $scope.decisionInstance.inputs.map(function(
            variable
          ) {
            const variableValue =
              variable.type === 'Date'
                ? new Date(variable.value)
                : variable.value;

            return {
              variable: {
                type: variable.type,
                value: variableValue,
                name: variable.clauseName || variable.clauseId,
                valueInfo: variable.valueInfo
              }
            };
          });
```

## Output Variable Handling

The output variable handling function maps the outputs of the decision instance in a similar way to the input handling function. It also checks the type of each variable and formats it accordingly. The output variables are then used in other parts of the application.

```javascript
          $scope.variables = $scope.decisionInstance.outputs.map(function(
            variable
          ) {
            const variableValue =
              variable.type === 'Date'
                ? new Date(variable.value)
                : variable.value;
            return {
              variable: {
                type: variable.type,
                value: variableValue,
                name:
                  variable.clauseName ||
                  variable.clauseId ||
                  variable.variableName,
                valueInfo: variable.valueInfo
              }
            };
          });
```
