title: Introduction to Tenants in Camunda Platform
---
A Tenant in the context of the Citi-camunda repository refers to a logical grouping of processes, cases, and tasks in the Camunda Platform. It is used to segregate data and configuration within the same Camunda installation. This is particularly useful in multi-tenant applications where you want to ensure data isolation between different tenants. The Tenant concept is implemented in various parts of the codebase, including REST API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting tenants.

# Tenant Isolation

This is the TenantEntity class, which represents a tenant in the system. It contains methods for setting and getting the tenant id, which is used to segregate data for different tenants.

# Starting a Process Instance with a Tenant

This is the StartProcessInstanceCmd class, which is used to start a new process instance. Notice the use of the tenant id in the startProcessInstanceByMessageAndTenantId method. This tenant id is used to segregate the process instance data for different tenants.
