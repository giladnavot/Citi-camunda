Integration in Citi-camunda refers to the process of combining different components of the software into a unified system. This is achieved through the use of modules such as 'engine-cdi' and 'engine-spring', each containing core functionalities that can be embedded into any Java application. The integration process ensures seamless interaction between these components, enabling efficient workflow and process automation.
