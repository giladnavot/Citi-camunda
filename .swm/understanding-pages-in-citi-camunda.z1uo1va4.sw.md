title: Understanding Pages in Citi-camunda
---
In Citi-camunda, 'Pages' refers to a directory in the codebase that contains scripts for different pages of the application. These scripts define the data and functionality for each page. For instance, the 'processInstance.js' and 'processDefinition.js' files contain a 'pageData' property, which is used to store and manage data specific to the process instance and process definition pages respectively.
