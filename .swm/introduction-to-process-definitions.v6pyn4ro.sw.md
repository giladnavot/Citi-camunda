title: Introduction to Process Definitions
---
A Process Definition in Camunda is an object structure representing an executable process composed of activities and transitions. It is created from process definition files (usually BPMN 2.0 XML files) that are added to a deployment artifact. At deploy time, the engine parses these files into an executable instance of a Process Definition. This instance can then be used to start a Process Instance. A Process Definition includes information such as the process id, key, name, version, and deployment id. It also provides methods to query and interact with deployed processes.

The Process Definition interface extends the ResourceDefinition interface, inheriting its methods. It also provides additional methods specific to process definitions. For example, the `getDescription` method returns the description of the process, `getVersionTag` returns the version tag of the process definition, and `isStartableInTasklist` returns a boolean indicating whether the process definition is startable in the Tasklist.

The ProcessDefinitionQuery interface allows programmatic querying of Process Definitions. It provides methods to filter and sort process definitions based on various properties such as process definition id, key, name, and version. For example, the `processDefinitionName` method only selects process definitions with the given name, and the `orderByProcessDefinitionName` method orders the query results by the name of the process definitions.

The CalledProcessDefinition interface extends the ProcessDefinition interface. It represents a process definition that is called by a call activity in another process. It provides additional methods to get the id of the calling process definition and the ids of the activities from which the process is called.

The DeploymentHandler interface defines custom behavior for determining what resources should be added to a new deployment. It provides methods to determine if a resource should be deployed, to find a duplicate deployment, and to determine deployments to resume by process definition key.

# ProcessDefinition Interface

This is the definition of the ProcessDefinition interface. It extends the ResourceDefinition interface and provides several methods to get information about the process definition, such as its description, start form key, suspension state, version tag, and whether it is startable in the tasklist.

```java
/** An object structure representing an executable process composed of
 * activities and transitions.
 *
 * Business processes are often created with graphical editors that store the
 * process definition in certain file format. These files can be added to a
 * {@link Deployment} artifact, such as for example a Business Archive (.bar)
 * file.
 *
 * At deploy time, the engine will then parse the process definition files to an
 * executable instance of this class, that can be used to start a {@link ProcessInstance}.

public interface ProcessDefinition extends ResourceDefinition {

  /** description of this process **/
  String getDescription();

  /** Does this process definition has a {@link FormService#getStartFormData(String) start form key}. */
```

# Usage of ProcessDefinition

Here, the ProcessDefinition interface is used in the DeployCmd class. This class is responsible for deploying process definitions to the Camunda platform.

```java
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.repository.ProcessDefinition;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.repository.Resource;
```

# Querying ProcessDefinitions

The ProcessDefinitionQuery interface provides a way to programmatically query for ProcessDefinitions. This is an example of its usage in the ProcessDefinitionQueryImpl class.

```java
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.util.CompareUtil;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.repository.ProcessDefinition;
import org.camunda.bpm.engine.repository.ProcessDefinitionQuery;
import org.camunda.bpm.model.bpmn.BpmnModelInstance;
import org.camunda.bpm.model.bpmn.instance.Documentation;
import org.camunda.bpm.model.xml.instance.ModelElementInstance;
import static org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.util.EnsureUtil.ensureNotNull;
import static org.camunda.bpm.engine.impl.util.EnsureUtil.ensurePositive;


/**
 * @author Tom Baeyens
 * @author Joram Barrez
 * @author Daniel Meyer
 * @author Saeid Mirzaei
 */
public class ProcessDefinitionQueryImpl extends AbstractQuery<ProcessDefinitionQuery, ProcessDefinition>
  implements ProcessDefinitionQuery {
```
