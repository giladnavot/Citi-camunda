title: Basic Concepts of Incident Handling
---
An Incident in the context of the Citi-camunda repository refers to an event that disrupts normal workflow execution. Incidents are typically created when an error occurs during the execution of a process instance. They provide detailed information about the error, such as the error message and the stack trace, which can be used for troubleshooting and error handling.

# Incident Creation

This is where an incident is created when an exception is thrown during the execution of a process instance. The `handleIncident` method takes in the process instance and the exception, and creates a new incident with the relevant information.

# Incident Resolution

Once the error has been fixed, the incident can be resolved using the `resolveIncident` method. This method takes in the process instance and the incident, and resolves the incident.

# Incident Functionality

This section will cover the main functions related to the Incident functionality in the Citi-camunda project.
