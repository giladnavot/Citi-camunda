title: Understanding Basic Concepts of Process Instance
---
A Process Instance in Camunda represents a single execution of a process definition. It is the concrete representation of a running process, containing the current state of the process, including the values of variables, the active activities, and the history of completed activities. Process Instances can be manipulated in various ways, such as being activated, suspended, or deleted. They can also have their variables retrieved or updated, and their execution state modified.

## Modifying Process Instance Execution State

This endpoint is used to modify the execution state of a Process Instance.

```ftl
      summary = "Modify Process Instance Execution State"
```
