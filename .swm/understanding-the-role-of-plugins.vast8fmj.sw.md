title: Understanding the Role of Plugins
---
Plugins in the Citi-camunda project are modular pieces of code that add specific functionality to the Camunda Cockpit, a web application for monitoring and managing workflows. They are implemented as AngularJS modules and are organized in a hierarchical directory structure. Each plugin has a main entry point, typically named `plugin.js`, which exports the AngularJS module. The module usually requires other modules, such as views or resources, to provide its functionality. Some plugins also provide diagram plugins, which are used to enhance the BPMN diagrams displayed in the Cockpit with additional information or interactive elements.

# Plugin Structure

Each plugin is structured as an AngularJS module. The `plugin.js` file exports the module, which includes other modules as dependencies. For instance, the `cockpit.plugin.base` module includes `viewsModule`, `resourcesModule`, and `dataModule` as dependencies.

# Plugin Usage

Plugins are used by requiring them and including them in the module dependencies. In this file, various plugins are required and included in the `cockpit.plugin.cockpitPlugins` module.

```javascript
import 'ui/cockpit/plugins/styles.less';

var angular = require('angular'),
  base = require('./base/app/plugin'),
  decisionList = require('./decisionList/app/plugin'),
  jobDefinition = require('./jobDefinition/app/plugin'),
  tasks = require('./tasks/app/plugin'),
  externalTasksTab = require('./external-tasks-process-instance-runtime-tab');

export default angular.module('cockpit.plugin.cockpitPlugins', [
  base.name,
  decisionList.name,
  jobDefinition.name,
  tasks.name,
  externalTasksTab.name
]);
```

# Diagram Plugins

Diagram plugins are a specific type of plugins used to extend the functionality of diagrams. They are required and included in the module dependencies just like other plugins.

```javascript
var angular = require('angular'),
  camCommon = require('ui/common/scripts/module/index'),
  diagramInstancePlugins = require('./processInstance/diagramPlugins'),
  diagramDefinitionPlugins = require('./processDefinition/diagramPlugins'),
  // dashboard
```

# Plugin Functions

The plugins in the Citi-camunda project are used to extend the functionality of the Camunda platform. They are implemented in various JavaScript files and are loaded when the platform starts. The main functions of these plugins include registering default views, counting instances, and handling call activities.

## registerDefaultView

The `registerDefaultView` function is used to register a default view for a specified key. It takes a key and a viewProvider object as parameters. The viewProvider object includes properties like id, label, url, controller, and priority. This function is used in various plugins to register their views.

```javascript
      /**
       * Registers the given viewProvider for the specified view
       *
       * View provider is an object like the following:
       *
       * <pre>
       *   {
       *     id: String, // id if the view
       *     label: String, // label of the view
       *     url: String, // url to the provided view; may be prefixed with plugin://
       *     controller: Function || String, // controller reference or name
       *     priority: number// priority of the view (default 0)
       *   }
       * </pre>
       *
       * @param {string} key
       * @param {Object} viewProvider
       */
      this.registerDefaultView = function(key, viewProvider) {
        // test if the plugin is excluded
        if (excludeExp && excludeExp.test(key + ':' + viewProvider.id)) {
```

## instanceCount

The `instanceCount` function is used to configure the instance count for a plugin. It is used in the diagram plugins of the base plugin.

```javascript
var instanceCount = require('./instanceCount');
var callActivity = require('./callActivity');

var ngModule = angular.module(
  'cockpit.plugin.base.views.definition.diagram-plugins',
  [camCommon.name]
);

ngModule.config(instanceCount);
ngModule.config(callActivity);
```

<SwmSnippet path="/webapps/frontend/ui/cockpit/plugins/base/app/views/processDefinition/diagramPlugins/index.js" line="24">

## callActivity

The `callActivity` function is used to configure the call activity for a plugin. It is used in the diagram plugins of the base plugin.

```javascript
var callActivity = require('./callActivity');

var ngModule = angular.module(
  'cockpit.plugin.base.views.definition.diagram-plugins',
  [camCommon.name]
);

ngModule.config(instanceCount);
ngModule.config(callActivity);
```
