title: Overview of Batch Operations
---
Batch in Citi-camunda refers to a set of operations that are executed as a group. These operations are typically related and are executed together to improve performance and efficiency. Batches are used in various parts of the application, such as process execution, task management, and process operations.

# Batch Processing

This is the BatchEntity class, which represents a batch process in Citi-camunda. It contains methods for setting and getting batch properties, such as the batch type, total jobs, batch configuration, etc. These properties are used to define and control the execution of the batch process.

# Batch Execution

This is the BatchExecutionJobHandler class, which is responsible for executing batch jobs. It contains methods for executing the batch job, handling failures, and managing retries. This class is a key component of the batch processing functionality in Citi-camunda.

# Batch Functionality

This section will cover the main functions of Batch in the Citi-camunda project.
