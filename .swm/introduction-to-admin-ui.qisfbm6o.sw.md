The Admin UI in Citi-camunda is a user interface that allows administrators to manage the system. It provides functionalities such as user management, system settings, and plugin management. The Admin UI is built using AngularJS and it interacts with the backend through the Camunda API. It is designed to be highly customizable with the ability to add plugins for additional functionalities.

# User Management

```html
<!-- # CE - camunda-bpm-webapp/ui/admin/client/scripts/pages/users.html -->
<section ng-cloak>
  <!-- <aside></aside> -->
  <div class="section-content">
    <header class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-8">
        <h3>{{ 'USERS_LIST_OF_USERS' | translate }}</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-4 text-right">
        <a class="btn btn-default"
           href="#/user-create">
          {{ 'USERS_ADD_USER' | translate }}
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus-sign"></span>
        </a>
      </div>
    </header>

    <div cam-searchable-area

# System Settings

This file defines the functionality for the system settings page in the Admin UI. It fetches the system settings providers and allows administrators to interact with them.

```javascript
    $scope.systemSettingsProviders = Views.getProviders({
      component: 'admin.system'
    }).map(function(plugin) {
      if (angular.isArray(plugin.access)) {
        var fn = $injector.invoke(plugin.access);

        fn(function(err, access) {
          if (err) {
            throw err;
          }

          plugin.accessible = access;
        });
      } else {
        plugin.accessible = true;
      }

      return plugin;
    });

    var selectedProviderId = $routeParams.section;
```
