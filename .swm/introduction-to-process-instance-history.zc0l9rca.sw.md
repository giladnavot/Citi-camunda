title: Introduction to Process Instance History
---
Process Instance History in Camunda refers to the historical data of a process instance. It is a record of all the events that have occurred during the lifecycle of a process instance, including start, end, and any tasks or activities that were executed. This historical data is crucial for auditing, analysis, and troubleshooting purposes.

## Accessing Process Instance History

This code snippet shows how to access the Process Instance History. The `get` method is used to retrieve the history of a specific process instance.

```ftl
      tag = "Historic Process Instance"
      summary = "Get List"
      desc = "Queries for historic process instances that fulfill the given parameters.
              The size of the result set can be retrieved by using the
              [Get Process Instance Count](${docsUrl}/reference/rest/history/process-instance/get-process-instance-query-count/) method." />
```

## Counting Process Instances

This code snippet shows how to get the count of process instances. The `get` method is used to retrieve the count of process instances.

```ftl
      tag = "Historic Process Instance"
      summary = "Get List Count"
      desc = "Queries for the number of historic process instances that fulfill the given parameters.
              Takes the same parameters as the [Get Process Instances](${docsUrl}/reference/rest/history/process-instance/get-process-instance-query/) method." />
