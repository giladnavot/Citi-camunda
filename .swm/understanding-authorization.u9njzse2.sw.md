title: Understanding Authorization
---
Authorization in the Citi-camunda project refers to the process of granting or denying access to specific resources within the application. It is a security measure that ensures only authenticated users with the appropriate permissions can access certain resources or perform certain actions.

## Authorization API Endpoints

This file is a template for the GET endpoint for an authorization. It is used to retrieve the details of a specific authorization.

```ftl
<#macro endpoint_macro docsUrl="">
{
  <@lib.endpointInfo
      id = "getAuthorization"
      tag = "Authorization"
      summary = "Get Authorization"
      desc = "Retrieves an authorization by id."
  />

  "parameters" : [
```

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/engine-rest/engine-rest-openapi/src/main/templates/paths/authorization/{id}/put.ftl" line="1">

---

This file is a template for the PUT endpoint for an authorization. It is used to update the details of a specific authorization.

```ftl
<#macro endpoint_macro docsUrl="">
{
  <@lib.endpointInfo
      id = "updateAuthorization"
      tag = "Authorization"
      summary = "Update an Authorization"
      desc = "Updates an authorization by id."
  />

  "parameters" : [
```

<SwmSnippet path="/engine-rest/engine-rest-openapi/src/main/templates/paths/authorization/{id}/delete.ftl" line="1">

---

This file is a template for the DELETE endpoint for an authorization. It is used to delete a specific authorization.

```ftl
<#macro endpoint_macro docsUrl="">
{
  <@lib.endpointInfo
      id = "deleteAuthorization"
      tag = "Authorization"
      summary = "Delete Authorization"
      desc = "Deletes an authorization by id."
  />

  "parameters" : [
```

<SwmSnippet path="/engine-rest/engine-rest-openapi/src/main/templates/paths/authorization/check/get.ftl" line="1">

---

This file is a template for the GET endpoint for checking authorization. It is used to check if a user is authorized to perform a certain action.

```ftl
<#macro endpoint_macro docsUrl="">
{
  <@lib.endpointInfo
      id = "isUserAuthorized"
      tag = "Authorization"
      summary = "Perform an Authorization Check"
      desc = "Performs an authorization check for the currently authenticated user."
  />

  "parameters" : [

# Authorization Functions

Let's delve into the key functions of Authorization in Citi-camunda.

<SwmSnippet path="/engine/src/main/java/org/camunda/bpm/engine/authorization/Authorization.java" line="1">

---

## Authorization.java

This Java class defines the core Authorization object in the Camunda engine. It likely includes methods for creating, updating, and deleting authorizations.

## FreeMarker Templates

The FreeMarker templates define the REST API endpoints for authorization. They include endpoints for getting, updating, and deleting an authorization by ID, checking an authorization, counting authorizations, and creating an authorization.

# Authorization Check Endpoint

Authorization Endpoint

<SwmSnippet path="/engine-rest/engine-rest-openapi/src/main/templates/paths/authorization/check/get.ftl" line="1">

---

## isUserAuthorized Endpoint

The `isUserAuthorized` endpoint is used to perform an authorization check for the currently authenticated user. It requires parameters such as `permissionName`, `resourceName`, `resourceType`, and optionally `resourceId` and `userId`. The endpoint returns a response indicating whether the user is authorized or not, along with potential error codes and their meanings.

```ftl
<#macro endpoint_macro docsUrl="">
{
  <@lib.endpointInfo
      id = "isUserAuthorized"
      tag = "Authorization"
      summary = "Perform an Authorization Check"
      desc = "Performs an authorization check for the currently authenticated user."
  />

  "parameters" : [

      <@lib.parameter
          name = "permissionName"
          location = "query"
          type = "string"
          required = true
          desc = "String value representing the permission name to check for."
      />

      <@lib.parameter
          name = "resourceName"
```
