title: Understanding Authorizations
---
Authorizations in Citi-camunda refer to the permissions given to users or groups to perform certain actions. It is a security measure to ensure that only authorized users have access to specific resources or operations. The authorization process checks the user's permissions before granting access to the requested resource. For instance, in the provided code, the 'AuthorizationResource' checks if the user has 'ALL' permissions for the 'authorization' resource.

# Authorization Definition

This is where the authorization is defined. The 'id' property is set to 'authorization', and the 'access' property is an array that includes 'AuthorizationResource' and a function that checks if the user has the required permissions.

```javascript
var template = require('./authorizations.html?raw');

module.exports = [
  'ViewsProvider',
  function(ViewsProvider) {
    ViewsProvider.registerDefaultView('admin.dashboard.section', {
      id: 'authorization',
      label: 'AUTHORIZATION_AUTHORIZATIONS',
      template: template,
      pagePath: '#/authorization',
      controller: [function() {}],
      access: [
        'AuthorizationResource',
        function(AuthorizationResource) {
          return function(cb) {
            AuthorizationResource.check({
              permissionName: 'ALL',
              resourceName: 'authorization',
              resourceType: 4
            })
              .$promise.then(function(response) {
```

# Authorization Check

This is where the authorization check is performed. The 'AuthorizationResource.check' function is called with the 'permissionName', 'resourceName', and 'resourceType' parameters. The function returns a promise that resolves to a response indicating whether the user is authorized or not.

```javascript
          return function(cb) {
            AuthorizationResource.check({
              permissionName: 'ALL',
              resourceName: 'authorization',
              resourceType: 4
            })
              .$promise.then(function(response) {
                cb(null, response.authorized);
              })
              .catch(cb);
          };
```

# Authorization Functionality

The 'registerDefaultView' function is used to register a default view in the admin dashboard. It has several properties that define the behavior and appearance of the view.

## registerDefaultView Function

The 'registerDefaultView' function is used to register a default view in the admin dashboard. It takes two parameters: the section id and an object that defines the properties of the view.

```javascript
    ViewsProvider.registerDefaultView('admin.dashboard.section', {
      id: 'authorization',
      label: 'AUTHORIZATION_AUTHORIZATIONS',
      template: template,
      pagePath: '#/authorization',
      controller: [function() {}],
      access: [
        'AuthorizationResource',
        function(AuthorizationResource) {
          return function(cb) {
            AuthorizationResource.check({
              permissionName: 'ALL',
              resourceName: 'authorization',
              resourceType: 4
            })
              .$promise.then(function(response) {
                cb(null, response.authorized);
              })
              .catch(cb);
          };
        }
