title: Introduction to the External Task Log
---
The External Task Log in Citi-camunda refers to a historical record of external tasks. It provides functionalities to retrieve these logs, their error details, and their count. These functionalities are exposed via REST APIs, which can be accessed through GET and POST requests. The logs provide valuable insights into the execution of external tasks, which are tasks that are processed by an external worker service.
