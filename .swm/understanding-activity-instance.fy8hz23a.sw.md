title: Understanding Activity Instance
---
An Activity Instance in the context of the Citi-camunda repository refers to a specific execution of an activity within a process. It is a historical record of the activity's execution, capturing details such as the start time, end time, and duration. This information is crucial for process analysis and optimization. The Activity Instance is part of the Camunda Platform's history service, which provides detailed information about the execution of processes and activities.

# Count of Historic Activity Instances

This API endpoint retrieves the count of Historic Activity Instances. It takes the same parameters as the Get Historic Activity Instance method.

```ftl
      tag = "Historic Activity Instance"
      summary = "Get List Count"
      desc = "Queries for the number of historic activity instances that fulfill the given parameters.
              Takes the same parameters as the [Get Historic Activity Instance](${docsUrl}/reference/rest/history/activity-instance/get-activity-instance-query/)  method." />
```

# Query for Historic Activity Instances

This API endpoint allows you to query for Historic Activity Instances. It provides a link to the Get Historic Activity Instance Count method for convenience.

```ftl
      tag = "Historic Activity Instance"
      summary = "Get List"
      desc = "Queries for historic activity instances that fulfill the given parameters.
              The size of the result set can be retrieved by using the
              [Get Historic Activity Instance Count](${docsUrl}/reference/rest/history/activity-instance/get-activity-instance-query-count/) method." />
