title: Understanding Cockpit Client Scripts
---
Cockpit Client Scripts in the Citi-camunda repository refer to the JavaScript files that are responsible for the client-side functionality of the Camunda Cockpit. These scripts handle tasks such as setting up the development environment, importing necessary libraries and modules, initializing the AngularJS application, and defining various AngularJS components such as services, directives, and controllers. They also include scripts for handling specific features like navigation, variable manipulation, and process diagram visualization. The scripts are organized into different directories based on their functionality, such as services, directives, and components.
