title: Overview of Job
---
A Job in Citi-camunda refers to a unit of work that the process engine needs to execute. Jobs are created during the execution of asynchronous continuations and timer events. They are stored in the database and executed by the Job Executor.

Jobs can be managed through the REST API. The `engine-rest/engine-rest-openapi/src/main/templates/paths/job/` directory contains templates for various job-related operations such as getting job details (`get.ftl`), creating a job (`post.ftl`), updating job suspension state (`suspended/put.ftl`), and setting job retries (`retries/post.ftl`).

Each job has a unique ID and operations can be performed on a specific job using this ID. For example, the `job/{id}/` directory contains templates for operations like deleting a job (`delete.ftl`), getting a job's stacktrace (`stacktrace/get.ftl`), and executing a job (`execute/post.ftl`).

# Job Creation

This is where a Job is created when an asynchronous task is encountered in the process. The Job is then added to the Job queue for later execution.

# Job Execution

This is the Job Executor, which is responsible for executing the Jobs in the Job queue. It periodically polls the Job queue and executes the Jobs in it.

# Job Functions

Let's delve into the functions related to 'Job' in the Citi-camunda repository.
