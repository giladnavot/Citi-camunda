title: Basic Concepts of Repository in Citi-camunda
---
A repository in the Citi-camunda project refers to a specific directory structure that contains scripts, configurations, and resources for a particular aspect of the application. For instance, the 'repository' directory in the 'webapps/frontend/ui/cockpit/client/scripts/' path contains scripts for managing and interacting with the repository data. This includes directives, controllers, and route configurations.

The 'repositoryData' property found in 'cam-cockpit-resources.js' is a key part of the repository's functionality. It's used to bind data to the scope of the directive, allowing it to be accessed and manipulated within the directive's context.

The 'camCockpitRepositoryViewCtrl' controller, defined in 'routes.js', is associated with the '/repository' route. This controller is responsible for handling the logic and data manipulation when the '/repository' route is accessed in the application.

# Repository Usage

In this code snippet, 'repositoryData' is a property of the scope object. This property is assigned a value using the '=' operator, which means that it will be bound to a corresponding property in the parent scope. This allows 'repositoryData' to be used as a repository for storing and managing data.

```javascript
      restrict: 'A',
      scope: {
        repositoryData: '='
      },
```

# Repository Functions

The Repository in Citi-camunda is a crucial part of the system, handling the storage and management of process definitions, deployments, and decisions. It is implemented in several parts of the codebase, both on the backend and the frontend.

## RepositoryService

The `RepositoryService` is a service provided by the process engine. It allows for the deployment of BPMN 2.0, CMMN 1.1 and DMN 1.1. It also provides methods for querying deployed process definitions, deployments and decisions.

## ReadOnlyIdentityProvider

The `ReadOnlyIdentityProvider` is an interface that provides read-only access to the identity service. It is used to fetch user and group information without the ability to make changes.

## TableDataManager

The `TableDataManager` is responsible for managing the data in the tables of the database. It provides methods for querying and manipulating the data.

## Frontend Repository

The frontend repository is responsible for displaying the repository data in the user interface. It uses directives to manage the data and controllers to handle user interactions.
