title: Exploring the External Task
---
An External Task in Camunda is a BPMN Service Task that is executed by an external worker. This allows for the distribution of the workload across multiple microservices or systems. The worker fetches and locks the task, performs the work, and then completes the task, providing any output variables.

# Defining an External Task

In this BPMN model, a Service Task is defined with an External implementation. The 'camunda:type' attribute is set to 'external' and the 'camunda:topic' attribute is set to the topic that the External Task Client will subscribe to.

# Implementing an External Task Client

This is an example of an External Task Client. It subscribes to the topic defined in the BPMN model and implements the task logic in the 'execute' method. When the task is successfully completed, the 'complete' method is called to inform the Camunda engine.

## ExternalTaskHandler

The `ExternalTaskHandler` interface defines the contract for classes that handle external tasks. It includes methods for handling a task, handling a failure, and handling a BPMN error.

## ExternalTaskQuery

The `ExternalTaskQuery` interface provides methods for querying external tasks based on various criteria. This includes filtering by process instance, activity, and execution, as well as ordering the results.
